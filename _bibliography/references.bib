  abstract = {Current teaching methods for architectural history seldom embrace building technology as an essential component of study. Accepting the premise that architectural history is a fundamental component to the overall architectural learning environment, it is argued that the study of construction history will further enhance student knowledge. This hypothesis created an opportunity to investigate how the study of construction history could be incorporated to strengthen present teaching methods. Strategies for teaching architectural history were analyzed with the determination that an incorporation of educational instructional design applications using object-oriented programming and hypermedia provided the optimal solution. This evaluation led to the development of the HISTCON interactive, multimedia educational computer program. Used initially to teach 19th Century iron and steel construction history, the composition of the program provides the mechanism to test the significance of construction history in the study of architectural history. Future development of the program will provide a method to illustrate construction history throughout the history of architecture. The study of architectural history, using a construction oriented methodology, is shown to be positively correlated to increased understanding of architectural components relevant to architectural history and building construction.},

  abstract = {In recent years we have witnessed how technology applied to built heritage has exponentially changed the daily practices of the various experts involved in the life cycle of buildings. The techniques of representation of historical architecture have been able to make use of new 3D survey tools as well as research methods capable of managing a large amount of data while improving the level of information (LOI) and accuracy of the surveyed artefacts. On the other hand, professionals still have to make use of a large number of exchange formats in order to share their digital representations (3D, 2D) and analysis. For this reason, this paper describes the research approach followed to obtain “standard” architectural representations of a heritage building in the Cultural Heritage domain. The word “standard” is used in its original meaning: “something established by authority, custom, or general consent as a model or example” (Collins Dictionary). In this context, 3D models have a primary role in the workflow because its position is in-between the 3D survey techniques that come first and the restoration/maintenance activities. The authors’ thought is that the workflow should be as smooth and sustainable as possible to have an effective standardization and collaboration among disciplines, sectors and technicians working in the different study areas.},

Anteriormente, a maioria destes documentos estava acessível apenas em suporte papel. A disponibilização destes documentos em meio eletrônico permitirá um maior e melhor acesso. Para desenvolver um instrumento de descrição em meio digital é necessária a definição do quadro de padrões, normas e metadados a serem utilizados. Para isso, primeiramente, buscou-se compreender a situação deste acervo em relação à descrição e acesso. Isso foi necessário porque o estabelecimento deste quadro foi baseado nas experiências anteriores, adequando-o as normas arquivísticas. A norma utilizada é a NOBRADE e o padrão de metadados é o do e-ARQ Brasil. Esse quadro deverá ser implementado gradualmente no sistema eletrônico da Universidade o SIE. Posteriormente, publicar-se-á o instrumento de descrição arquivística em meio eletrônico.

According to this conceptual proposal, the HBIM model of the Charterhouse of Jerez has been generated, considering the information required for strategic planning of the main areas of action for heritage management: research, protection, conservation and dissemination.},

It has been implemented into a BIM (Building Information Modeling) informative system for the AEC industry (Architecture Engineering and Construction). The IFC format has changed interoperability processes concerning architectural and technical entities in a semantic way. However, because this standard open format was specifically designed for the modern AEC industry, it may not cater to the demands of cultural heritage assets. Since IFC classification is fundamental for informative systems, it should become a standard also concerning heritage assets, even if nowadays there is no regularized IFC classification for historical existing buildings. Specific cultural heritage peculiarities therefore need semantic classification based on historical asset families. For this reason, this work is based on a proposal and experimental IFC classification implemented inside an HBIM open source software (FreeCAD), whereby limitations of IFC standards can be overcome thanks to the freedom of access to libraries and codes. Moreover, this work is based on IFC objects management outside the platform for interoperability purposes.},

Em apenas um dia, fez-se um mapeamento detalhado do que havia sido destruído e do que ainda restava de pé na igreja, um ícone da arquitetura gótica.

  abstract = {In an extensive review of existing literature a number of observations were made in relation to the current approaches for recording and modelling existing buildings and environments: Data collection and pre-processing techniques are becoming increasingly automated to allow for near real-time data capture and fast processing of this data for later modelling applications. Current BIM software is almost completely focused on new buildings and has very limited tools and pre-defined libraries for modelling existing and historic buildings. The development of reusable parametric library objects for existing and historic buildings supports modelling with high levels of detail while decreasing the modelling time. Mapping these parametric objects to survey data, however, is still a time-consuming task that requires further research. Promising developments have been made towards automatic object recognition and feature extraction from point clouds for as-built BIM. However, results are currently limited to simple and planar features. Further work is required for automatic accurate and reliable reconstruction of complex geometries from point cloud data. Procedural modelling can provide an automated solution for generating 3D geometries but lacks the detail and accuracy required for most as-built applications in AEC and heritage fields.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The birth of virtual reality marked a new path forward and also gave a fresh view of reality, allowing alternative ‘readings’ of cultural heritage. This new way of representation and simulation was soon associated with the term virtual environment, used to indicate those interactive three-dimensional models that could be navigated and that simulated a place, building, or synthetic representation scheme in real time. A virtual environment is like a “microscope for the mind” that allows you to elaborate amplified projections of the material world, to “look beyond” simple appearances and to make logical connections between elements grouped together. In recent years, virtual environments have been greeted positively by the public and scholars, testified by the quantity of thematic conferences on the subject of Virtual Archaeology. Despite this, there are still many contradictions found in the varying terms and the diverse aims of the developing disciplines that gravitate around the field of virtual reality such as Cultural Virtual Environment, Virtual Restoration, Virtual Archaeology, Enhanced Reality, and Mixed Reality. The spread of new media has upset the traditional systems of communication such as books, television, radio and even the roles of some cultural stakeholder. With this in mind, the role of virtual heritage also consists in transmitting information using the language and cognitive metaphors used in video-games, considering these as cultural paradigms for a form of communication that is freed from the classic rules of elite culture. It is quite frequent to find projects of digital promotion for monuments that are characterised by difficulty of access, or for objects that have been taken from their original context. One solution to enhance the accessibility of those sites is certainly the use of some visual computing technologies which without presuming to be the ultimate answer to the problems posed, try to offer communications tools that permit an effective support to the visit.},

Certainly, establishing and monitoring an       accreditation scheme is a time consuming process, as is developing and implementing standards within museums. Yet, this paper suggests that in spite of such logistical constraints, stricter       adherence to international museum standards and the introduction of an accreditation scheme that encourages this practice would bring numerous benefits to South Africa's museums. These       advantages extend beyond ensuring that museum collections are carefully preserved and well managed. They also offer possibilities for professionalising our sector, attracting competent young       people to pursue a long-term career in museums and for making South Africa a more active player within the international museum community. This paper argues, moreover, that South Africa might       consider adopting the already established and internationally recognised SPECTRUM standard for museum collections management as the basis for developing a future accreditation scheme.},

However, the project grant was for three years and the economic downturn has diminished opportunities for continued funding. The challenge is to demonstrate the importance and value of maintaining these e-resources, and to make it feasible for the resource owners to do so without the DHO if necessary. ICT systems can support cost effective and value-adding access and management of resources in a way that might be sustained in the short-term by organizations and projects that lack the funding, staffing, and skills to build and operate a digital preservation environment. In this project paper we describe how the DHO uses technology to promote the value of preservation and interoperability of e-resources, and to provide a means for achieving these goals in the face of significant sustainability risks.},

Nevertheless, traditionally, conservation and restoration has been a poorly documented discipline, which has led not only to a lack of standardization and awareness about the processes carried out in the past, but also poses problems both when new restoration works are necessary and for the preventive conservation of the elements of heritage. This study sets out to propose a conceptual framework to explore the relationship between conservation of heritage and information management on the basis of case studies; in particular: a spatial data infrastructure (SDI) of a regional government concerning an endangered plant (wild grapevine) with an important potential for cultural and touristic uses in a wine-making region; an open data guide—the Digital Guide of Andalusian Cultural Heritage; a university repository connected to Europeana, which contains reports and outcomes of projects of geometric documentation of elements of heritage; a repository of an organization in charge of the protection and care of the heritage; and finally, two examples of the use of heritage building information models (HBIM) in complex monuments. After discussing the characteristics of each case, this paper concludes that, although the availability of information and tools is growing, further progress is still necessary concerning the interoperability, outreach and reuse of the different solutions.},

Cultural heritages connects generations over time and we need to preserve them. Architects, historians, travelers etc. They visit many historical sites where it often becomes difficult for them to identify and get historical details about the monument they are interested in. The task of archiving, documenting and sharing the knowledge of these cultural assets is challenging due to the scale and reliability of the information. An accurate prediction of the images to its correct label (heritage site) allows more proficient searches through specific terms, thus helping in the studying and understanding the heritage assets. Classification of data, which involve images, is complex and also time consuming. The present state of art of machine learning techniques can be harnessed to atomize the classification of images. The advent of high processing computing resources, state of art machine learning and deep learning algorithms provide tangible solutions. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing platform to collect Indian Digital Heritage Space (IHDS) monuments data, perform image classification and query based retrieval of Image labels. Further we designed a transfer learning based image classifier, which retrained using IHDS dataset on pre-trained MobileNet V2 architecture over ImageNet Dataset. The proposed transfer learning algorithm shows inference accuracy of 98.75\%. We demonstrate our crowd source framework using a web application, which is part of Indian Digital Heritage Space (IHDS) project funded by DST, Government of India, New Delhi.},

The grammar is in 2D and captures all the variability of libraries from the simpler forms of the Hellenistic period to the more monumental of the Roman period, creating a vast range of designs. The paper presents the grammar-generated plans of the known libraries based on the evidence in the archaeological record. A frequency analysis of the occurrence of the rules in the derivations ranks the different characteristics of libraries and the architectural forms with which they occur in the corpus, to determine the probability of specific rules and to interpret them as mandatory or optional. The contribution of this work is that the shape grammar summarizes the design principles of ancient libraries visually and helps establish the building type of the ancient library. The frequency analysis assists tremendously in the reconstruction of fragmentarily preserved ancient libraries by providing a system in the reconstruction of the missing parts, when ambiguity is involved.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to employ a case study of the Omeka content management system to demonstrate how the adoption and implementation of a metadata standard (in this case, Dublin Core) can result in contrasting rhetorical arguments regarding metadata utility, quality, and reliability. In the Omeka example, the author illustrate a conceptual disconnect in how two metadata stakeholders – standards creators and standards users – operationalize metadata quality. For standards creators such as the Dublin Core community, metadata quality involves implementing a standard properly, according to established usage principles; in contrast, for standards users like Omeka, metadata quality involves mere adoption of the standard, with little consideration of proper usage and accompanying principles. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses an approach based on rhetorical criticism. The paper aims to establish whether Omeka’s given ends (the position that Omeka claims to take regarding Dublin Core) align with Omeka’s guiding ends (Omeka’s actual argument regarding Dublin Core). To make this assessment, the paper examines both textual evidence (what Omeka says) and material-discursive evidence (what Omeka does). Findings The evidence shows that, while Omeka appears to argue that adopting the Dublin Core is an integral part of Omeka’s mission, the platform’s lack of support for Dublin Core implementation makes an opposing argument. Ultimately, Omeka argues that the appearance of adopting a standard is more important than its careful implementation. Originality/value This study contributes to our understanding of how metadata standards are understood and used in practice. The misalignment between Omeka’s position and the goals of the Dublin Core community suggests that Omeka, and some portion of its users, do not value metadata interoperability and aggregation in the same way that the Dublin Core community does. This indicates that, although certain values regarding standards adoption may be pervasive in the metadata community, these values are not equally shared amongst all stakeholders in a digital library ecosystem. The way that standards creators (Dublin Core) understand what it means to “adopt a standard” is different from the way that standards users (Omeka) understand what it means to “adopt a standard.”},

The objectives of working with these two universes are to map, characterize and discuss ideas, approaches and tensions between them and the theoretical discussions of Museology and Information Science about what is documentation, without the intention of getting any unique definition. The reason for this study is the need to explore the terminological differences inherent to the universe of museums and discuss how to work with them and from them. The methodology is exploratory, descriptive, comparative and historical. The research results reinforce the polysemy of the term documentation showing that the diversity of meanings strongly influence professional practice, such as the emphasis, in some contexts, of the idea of control of museum collection with administrative purpose that prevails in light of the aim of producing and dissemination of knowledge from collections. It concludes that it is still needed to promote the consolidation of methodologies and procedures that consider documentation as an activity of knowledge creation and also a professional practice.},

In the latter case, the great variety of Cultural Heritage (CH) distributed over the European territory, and the ability of BIM to cover the life of buildings or/and other artefacts from a geometric, descriptive, physical and static point of view, have stimulated the development of the HBIM (Historic BIM) modelling. The HBIM approach should consider the complexity of historical or archaeological buildings or artefacts, with particular attention to possible fragmentation or incompleteness of parts.

As a result of this interest, the internet contains numerous websites devoted to unrealised architectural projects and the authors of this text outline the problems inherent in visiting and reviewing these resources, and the factors that affect their usefulness as trustworthy sources of knowledge on the subject. In answer to problems that have been noted, the resulting proposal involves the setting up of a digital repository that will serve as a specific sort of base resource.

Our cyberinfrastructure contains (i) the McGill-Harvard-Yenching Library Ming Qing Women's Writings database (MQWW), the only online database on historical Chinese women's writings, (ii) the China Biographical Database, the authority for Chinese historical people, and (iii) the China Historical Geographical Information System, one of the first historical geographic information systems. Key to this integration is that linked databases retain separate identities as bases of knowledge, while they possess sufficient semantic interoperability to allow for multidatabase concepts and to support cross-database queries on an ad hoc basis. Computational ontologies create underlying semantics for database access. This paper focuses on the spatial component in a humanities cyberinfrastructure, which includes issues of conflicting data, heterogeneous data models, disambiguation, and geographic scale. First, we describe the methodology for integrating the databases. Then we detail the system architecture, which includes a tier of ontologies and schema. We describe the user interface and applications that allow for cross-database queries. For instance, users should be able to analyze the data, examine hypotheses on spatial and temporal relationships, and generate historical maps with datasets from MQWW for research, teaching, and publication on Chinese women writers, their familial relations, publishing venues, and the literary and social communities. Last, we discuss the social side of cyberinfrastructure development, as people are considered to be as critical as the technical components for its success.},

O Rural Mídia foi desenvolvido utilizando o modelo Dublin Core (DC) para descrição de seu acervo, acrescido de pequenas adaptações introduzidas diante da necessidade de adequar-se a especificidades meramente institucionais. Este modelo de metadados baseado no Dublin Core, adaptado para o Banco de Imagem, possui características que endossam a sua adoção, como a simplicidade na descrição dos recursos, entendimento semântico universal (dos elementos), escopo internacional e extensibilidade (o que permite sua adaptação às necessidades adicionais de descrição).},

We apply graph analysis and visualizations as well as natural language analysis over a database of over 11,000 artworks in order to address three types of questions related, respectively, to the formation and sustainability of large cultures, the semantic content of the network we analyze, and the role of art as an institution that contributes to sustain large-scale socities. The results also help to design a methodology that can be exported to other projects in Digital Humanities.},

  abstract = {Em 2017 foi fundado o Laboratório em Rede de Humanidades Digitais (Larhud), fruto do grupo de pesquisa que se dedica aos estudos críticos e às práticas em Humanidades Digitais. Sua criação teve como objetivo construir um canal estruturado de colaboração entre os pesquisadores internos e externos com foco no desenvolvimento e na reflexão sobre o pensar em soluções metodológicas para a pesquisa nas humanidades. Um caminho adotado pelo Larhud é criar um repositório digital temático, para reunir o conjunto da produção científica e acadêmica dos integrantes do GP, contribuindo para ampliar a visibilidade de sua produção e preservar sua memória. Um repositório pode ser definido como um local de armazenamento, de guarda e arquivamento de objetos digitais. Quanto ao seu propósito, se classifica como institucional – um espaço onde se armazenam os documentos administrativos, acadêmicos e científicos de uma instituição – ou temático – guarda objetos relacionados a uma determinada área sem limites institucionais – cada um com características e estrutura próprias. O artigo propõe apresentar um estudo descritivo, detalhando o passo a passo relacionadoà estruturação das etapas de navegação, organização e representação da informação no contexto do repositório pela perspectiva da arquitetura da informação. A etapa inicial foi identificar seus usuários: administradores, pesquisadores e possíveis visitantes. A etapa atual consiste na organização e representação da informação a partir da definição das áreas temáticas, comunidades e coleções que irão compor estruturalmente o repositório, bem como da seleção do tipo de metadados que serão utilizados.},
